            Python does not use '	&#123; 	&#125;' to enclose blocks of code for if/loops/function etc.. Instead, Python uses the colon (:) and indentation/whitespace to group statements. The boolean test for an if does not need to be in parenthesis (big difference from C++/Java), and it can have *elif* and *else* clauses (mnemonic: the word "elif" is the same length as the word "else").
            Any value can be used as an if-test. The "zero" values all count as false: None, 0, empty string, empty list, empty dictionary. There is also a Boolean type with two values: True and False (converted to an int, these are 1 and 0). Python has the usual comparison operations: ==, !=, &#60;, &#60;=, &#62;, &#62;=. Unlike Java and C, == is overloaded to work correctly with strings. The boolean operators are the spelled out words *and*, *or*, *not* (Python does not use the C-style && || !). Here's what the code might look like for a policeman pulling over a speeder -- notice how each block of then/else statements starts with a : and the statements are grouped by their indentation:
        </p>
        <p class="exampleCode">
            if speed &#62;= 80:
            <br>print 'License and registration please'
            <br>if mood == 'terrible' or speed >= 100:
            <br>print 'You have the right to remain silent.'
            <br>elif mood == 'bad' or speed >= 90:
            <br>print "I'm going to have to write you a ticket."
            <br>write_ticket()
            <br>else:
            <br>print "Let's try to keep it under 80 ok?"
        </p>

          I find that omitting the ":" is my most common syntax mistake when typing in the above sort of code, probably since that's an additional thing to type vs. my C++/Java habits. Also, don't put the boolean test in parens -- that's a C/Java habit. If the code is short, you can put the code on the same line after ":", like this (this applies to functions, loops, etc. also), although some people feel it's more readable to space things out on separate lines.
