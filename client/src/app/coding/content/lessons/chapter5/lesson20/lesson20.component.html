            The power of regular expressions is that they can specify patterns, not just fixed characters. Here are the most basic patterns which match single chars:
      </p>     
      <ul class="lessonContent">
        <li>a, X, 9, < -- ordinary characters just match themselves exactly. The meta-characters which do not match themselves because they have special meanings are: . ^ &#36; * + ? &#123; [ ] \ | 	&#40; &#41; (details below)</li>
        <li>. (a period) -- matches any single character except newline '\n'</li>
        <li>\w -- (lowercase w) matches a "word" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Note that although "word" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word. \W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.</li>
        <li>\b -- boundary between word and non-word</li>
        <li>\s -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \n\r\t\f]. \S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.</li>
        <li>\t, \n, \r -- tab, newline, return</li>
        <li>\d -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support but \d, but they all support \w and \s)
        <li>^ = start, $ = end -- match the start or end of the string</li>
        <li>\ -- inhibit the "specialness" of a character. So, for example, use \. to match a period or \\ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \@, to make sure it is treated just as a character.</li>
      </ul>
