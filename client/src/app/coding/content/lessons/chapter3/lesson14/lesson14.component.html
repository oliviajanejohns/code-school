      Chapter 3: Python Sorting - Tuples

        A tuple is a fixed size grouping of elements, such as an (x, y) co-ordinate. Tuples are like lists, except they are immutable and do not change size (tuples are not strictly immutable since one of the contained elements could be mutable). Tuples play a sort of "struct" role in Python -- a convenient way to pass around a little logical, fixed size bundle of values. A function that needs to return multiple values can just return a tuple of the values. For example, if I wanted to have a list of 3-d coordinates, the natural python representation would be a list of tuples, where each tuple is size 3 holding one (x, y, z) group.

        To create a tuple, just list the values within parenthesis separated by commas. The "empty" tuple is just an empty pair of parenthesis. Accessing the elements in a tuple is just like a list -- len(), [ ], for, in, etc. all work the same.      </p>
      <p class="exampleCode">
        tuple = (<span class="lit">1</span>, <span class="lit">2</span>, <span class="str">'hi'</span>)<br>
        <span class="kwd">print</span> len(tuple)   <span class="comment">## 3</span><br>
        <span class="kwd">print</span> tuple[<span class="lit">2</span>]     <span class="comment">## hi</span><br>
        tuple[<span class="lit">2</span>] = 'bye'   <span class="comment">## NO, tuples cannot be changed</span><br>
        tuple = (<span class="lit">1</span>, <span class="lit">2</span>, <span class="str">'bye'</span>)  <span class="comment">## this works</span>
      </p>
      <p class="lessonContent">
        To create a size-1 tuple, the lone element must be followed by a comma.
      </p>
      <p class="exampleCode">
        tuple = (<span class="str">'hi'</span>,)   <span class="comment">## size-1 tuple</span>
      </p>

        It's a funny case in the syntax, but the comma is necessary to distinguish the tuple from the ordinary case of putting an expression in parentheses. In some cases you can omit the parenthesis and Python will see from the commas that you intend a tuple.
        Assigning a tuple to an identically sized tuple of variable names assigns all the corresponding values. If the tuples are not the same size, it throws an error. This feature works for lists too.

      <p class="exampleCode">
        (x, y, z) = (<span class="lit">42</span>, <span class="lit">13</span>, <span class="str">"hike"</span>)<br>
        <span class="kwd">print</span> z  <span class="comment">## hike</span><br>
        (err_string, err_code) = <span class="typ">Foo</span>()  <span class="comment">## Foo() returns a length-2 tuple </span>
